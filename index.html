          ðŸ˜ŠI started my journey when I was around 8. I started programming
        </p>
        <p class="section"> <!-- Second line of text. -->
          on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/mileswk/">Scratch,</a> and then worked on Python.
        </p>
        <p class="section"> <!-- Third line of text. -->
          I programmed python for a while, and then started to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p class="section"> <!-- Third line of text. -->
          I finally went to <a href="https://replit.com/@MilesWK/">Replit</a> and then now I am on <a href="https://glitch.com/@MilesWK">Glitch</a>!

        <p class="section"> <!-- First line of text: section class makes the space between the lines go away. -->
          ðŸ’»I like programming. As I said, I started when I was around eight to ten years old.
        </p>
        <p class="section"> <!-- Second line of text. -->
          I learned CSS animations fairly recently, and now I am working on
        </p>
        <p class="section"> <!-- Third line of text. -->
          my javascript. There is barely any JavaScript for this page. As for python,  
        </p>
        <p class="section"> <!-- Third line of text. -->
          I have made an AI Discord bot, but right now it is not running.

        <p class="section"> <!-- First line of text: section class makes the space between the lines go away. -->
          ðŸŽ¶I make music! I do it with a MIDI keyboard, GarageBand, and a M-Audio 
        </p>

      <p class="section"> <!-- First line of text: section class makes the space between the lines go away. -->
        I have a few projects that I am proud of. First, this website that you are looking at,
      </p>
      <p class="section"> <!-- Second line of text. -->
        Second, <a href="https://click-the-button-mileswk.glitch.me/">Click The Button</a>. This was my first javascript project.

      <p class="section"> <!-- Third line of text. -->
        Third, <a href="https://worlds-hardest-game-mileswk.glitch.me/">World's Hardest Game.</a> This game takes a spin on a classic clicker!

        So, where will my journy go next? Well, it is hard to say.
      </p>
      <p class="section"> <!-- Second line of text. -->
        I will probably persue a carrer in cyber security, but who knows what will happen!
      </p>
      <p class="section"> <!-- Third line of text. -->
        For now, I will keep programming, making music, and most importantly... <b>LEARNING!</b>
